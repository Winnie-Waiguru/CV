            <p><em> <strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/winfred-wangari-6a35b8232/">Software Developer</a></strong></em></p>
            <p>Wangari &#128103;was an active child who always came up with creative ways of doing activities. Disregarding
                the status quo, this was often condemned as it did not conform to society. This pushed her to want a 
                career where she could freely express her inquisitive nature. She discovered a place where she belonged,
                a place she was encouraged to explore, spot problems, and find innovative solutions; technology. As a
                software developer, she enjoys problem-solving and is predisposed to using tech to solve problems in
                different sectors, particularly the finance sector in Africa.
